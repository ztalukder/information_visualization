Visualization 1:
The initial sketch is how the final visualization was made, except the colors. This visulization used countries on both x and y axis because it lets one see who donated to what countries. The countries are sorted in order of who received the most or donated the most. The color was chosen to be scalePow instead of linear because it shows much more variance between the colors, even if the numnbers are not necessarily close to one another. This lets one compare the colors much easier. 

Visualization 2:
Omitted

Visualization 3:
The initial sketch was thought to use the 5 points of a star. However, this seemed unclear and 5 circles were used instead. Each individual circle represents if the donator donated to the receiver with that specific reason. The legend shows what each circle means. Light gray is used to highlight the appropriate circle that represents each purpose. The data is also sorted by how many times money was donated for these reasons. The image of the visualization is heavily zoomed out to fit all of it in a single screen.
